# NBASportVUAnalysis
An analysis of NBA SportVU data in Python. 
We are working from Temple University to apply Data Mining and Machine Learning techniques on the SportVU data taken from the 2015-2016 NBA season.

Some of our major interests:
* Cleaning the data and understanding what causes the inconsistencies with respect to game clock and shot clock.
* Using the Play-By-Play (PBP) data to learn how to automate an annotation bot to identify events such as shots, rebounds, steals, etc.
* Using the (x, y, z) coordinate data to create a predictor for what will happen at a time t (where t represents the end of the possession),  given the coordinates of time x, where x is any time within that same possession.
